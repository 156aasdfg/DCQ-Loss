# DCQ-Loss
Dual-Criterion Quality Loss for Blind Image Quality Assessment


You can directly replace this loss function with the original MSE loss function. 

You can directly integrate the code from DCQ_Loss into your project. For convenience, we have provided the core code. Additionally, we recommend using the IQA-PyTorch codebase as a foundation since our implementation is based on it. IQA-PyTorch is a very convenient library for image quality assessment. Here is the link: [IQA-PyTorch](https://github.com/chaofengc/IQA-PyTorch).
